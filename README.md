The aim is to train a GAN(generative
adversarial network) to produce synthetic images of multiple types of cancers
and use these to train a model. Based on this the deep learning model will be
specialized in identifying which type of cancer a patient specifically suffers
from. Multiple datasets containing images of different types of cancers will be
fed to the GAN to enable its image-generation. Once the synthetic images have
reached a specific quality, they will be added on to the dataset and used for training
our cancer-prediction model.
